# Introduction

Welcome to the **RealTime's SMS API Documentation**. You can use our API to view your account's balance, to send SMS messages and to view detailed information about a sent SMS, including the final network operator to which the sms has been delivered as well as the final cost of the sms.

This **Restful** API implements the **OAuth2** authentication mechanism, with **Grant Type** "**Client Credentials**". To get your API client credentials \(**Client ID**, **Client Secret**\), please login to your account's [web panel](https://www.rti-sms.com/), using your **E-mail** and your **Password**.

All tokens in the current API are **securely encrypted** with [JWT](https://jwt.io/).

For questions or more information, you may [contact us](https://www.real-time.cl/contacto/).
